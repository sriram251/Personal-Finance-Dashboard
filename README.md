## 🧩 Why This Matters

This project proves how powerful **frontend development** can be when used creatively. With **IndexedDB** and **offline-first design**, I’ve shown how complex financial tools can be built entirely in the browser — no server required.

It’s a great example of what you can build with **vanilla JavaScript**, modern browser APIs, and thoughtful UX design.
